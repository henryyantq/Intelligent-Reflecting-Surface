# Intelligent-Reflecting-Surface
An implementation of the IRSs model in Keras.

In this implementation, we use a neural network with several layers of dense and activation functions to learn the optimal reflecting patterns for the IRS. We then use the trained model to design the IRS by multiplying the reflecting patterns with the channel matrix.

Note that this implementation is just a starting point and may need to be modified depending on the specifics of your use case. Additionally, there are other approaches for designing IRSs, such as optimization algorithms and heuristic methods, that may be more suitable for certain scenarios.
